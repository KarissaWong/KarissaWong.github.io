						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there were actual mathematical models to determine font size pairings, 
								which I think is super helpful and neat. The modular scale uses ratios based
								on geometry, nature, and music, which I didn't think could be sources of typography 
								inspiration. An example of a natural ratio is the perfect fourth, which decreases in smaller 
								increments than the golden ratio. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I really appreciated the typography resources they included. I've heard of 
								typewolf and google fonts, but I didn't realized that there were websites like
								CreativeBloq, Awwwards, and Invision. This will be very helpful for me moving forward. 
								 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When it comes to choosing type, keep the following principles in mind: readability, legibility, and purpose." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
