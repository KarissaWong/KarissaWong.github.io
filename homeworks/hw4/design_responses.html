					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that checking color contrast is standard practice in the industry. It's also 
								helpful to create texture instead of only color to design for those visually impaired.
								By being conscious of these options and designing for many, we can create a more inclusive 
								online community.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the informational specification of color contrast. The article stated 
								that "To meet W3Câ€™s minimum AA rating, your background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1."
								This helps me as a designer to be more mindful of the exact ratio. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Accessibility in digital product design is the practice of crafting experiences for all people, including those of us with visual, speech, auditory, physical, or cognitive disabilities." </p>
						</li>
