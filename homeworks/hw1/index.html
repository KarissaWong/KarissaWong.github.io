    <p>Hey! I'm a sophomore really interested in all design--I have a love and appreciation for all
        forms of art, especially practical ones. In my free time I love to watch cooking shows,
        glass blowing shows, fashion shows, interior design shows, or really any show that shows
        creativity. I also have a 8 month old kitten, who I love to play tag with. </p>

        <li>Studying apps we use daily is helpful for growing as a designer</li>
        <li>I think the gifs showing app deconstruction was cool</li>
        <li>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said 
            Search here but instead they mention a specific city. Though 
            I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility 
            of it is exciting." - I thought that this commentary was insightful.</li>
