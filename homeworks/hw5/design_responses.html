                            <p> Clever animations can help make a page feel streamlined, informational and luxurious.
                                On the other hand, I feel like too many animations can feel distracting
                                and take away from functionality. Although they're cool, I'd be pretty
                                annoyed if I had to wait for animations to load just to do a few simple
                                tasks.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part was the variety of examples and no actual text from
                                the article. It was really neat seeing different types of animations in
                                different contexts. Sometimes they were simple transitions, but other times
                                they sort of showed in a skeuomorphism way what the app was doing. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> Index&Sidebar Animation by Arvin was one of my favorites because it was so simple 
                                but clean and supportive of the user's actions. 
                                The Add to Cart Interaction by Dannniel for Norde was another favorite because it was
                                such a fun animation but didn't take away from the human computer interaction. It looked
                                like it had haptics, and I really like the layering design/effects the designer used. 
                                easygrow.io app preview by Edmond Vasar for ELEMENTS is also my favorite because I love
                                how they incorporated perspective and you feel depth. The color transition is also really
                                smooth, and overall I love how it feels.</p>
