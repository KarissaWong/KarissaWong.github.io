					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> Messenger (website) </p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/before.png">
							 
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/after.png">
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> This website is for users who want to communicate (mostly text) casually with people. The main users of 
								messenger are usually younger, perhaps around the millennial generation and younger. The 
								design accomplishes the communication goal by making it very straight forward and the main focus
								of the site. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> An issue is that the space for chatting is absolutely huge, while the sidebar of chats is narrow. 
								Instead, I think it would be better to make the chat list to chat ratio at least 1:2, with the chat 
								list at least 1/3 of the page. That way, users can see more information from the chat list. 
								With the extra space, we can see more than just the last message, but also the last two messages of the chat.
								<br><br>
								The very left sidebar options are unnoticeable because they are not in the proximity where most people would 
								expected it to be. I think those functions would be much better placed at the top of the Chats list, on a 
								horizontal bar instead of a vertical one. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
