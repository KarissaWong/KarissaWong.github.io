					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> What I found really interesting was that Wayfair uses multiples of 8s to
								determine their padding. I think that's really smart because it makes spacing
								so cohesive and consistent, while also really easy to determine. It makes 
								deciding padding width much more efficient. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was seeing the examples of the wayfair designs
								with different padding. I think it's really eye opening and impactful
								because it doesn't seem like 8 pxs of padding here and there would really
								make a difference but it adds up. The second design with more more padding 
								is definitely more readable and comfortable.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The rule states that the spacing between every design element should be a multiple 
								of 8 pixels; this means that the spacing could be 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 pixels and so on." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
